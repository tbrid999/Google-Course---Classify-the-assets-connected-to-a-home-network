Explanation of Classifications
Smart TV:

Notes: The Smart TV is used for streaming services and has no sensitive information stored. It connects to the network only when streaming is active.
Sensitivity: Classified as Public because compromising this device would have minimal impact on the business or sensitive data.
External HDD:

Notes: The external hard drive is a critical asset that contains backups, client data, and other business-critical documents. It is frequently connected to the network for data transfer.
Sensitivity: Classified as Confidential because unauthorized access could lead to data breaches, financial loss, and reputational harm.
Personal Tablet:

Notes: The personal tablet contains online banking apps and personal files. While it is not directly tied to the business, compromise could lead to financial risks.
Sensitivity: Classified as Sensitive because the device contains personal financial information that requires protection.
This asset inventory ensures that devices connected to the home network are accounted for, their risks are assessed, and appropriate sensitivity classifications are assigned. This approach helps prioritize security efforts to protect critical assets effectively.
